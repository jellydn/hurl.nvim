function hurl.request(request, callback)
  -- Implement handling of different types of HTTP requests and response statuses
  -- Modify the existing code to handle different request methods and response statuses
  -- Return the response object with the correct status code

  -- Check the request method
  if request.method == 'GET' then
    -- Handle GET request
    -- ...
  elseif request.method == 'POST' then
    -- Handle POST request
    -- ...
  -- Add more conditions for other request methods

  -- Call the callback function with the response object
  callback(response)
end

function hurl.run_current_file(args, callback)
  -- Implement correct reading and execution of HTTP requests from .hurl files
  -- Update the code to properly parse the .hurl file and execute the HTTP requests within it

  -- Read the .hurl file
  local file_content = read_file(args[1])

  -- Parse the file content and extract the HTTP requests
  local requests = parse_hurl_file(file_content)

  -- Execute each HTTP request and collect the responses
  local responses = {}
  for _, request in ipairs(requests) do
    local response = execute_http_request(request)
    table.insert(responses, response)
  end

  -- Call the callback function with the responses
  callback(responses)
end

```

Remember to update the existing functions `hurl.request` and `hurl.run_current_file` to include the necessary changes.

Additionally, comprehensive unit tests should be added to cover all edge cases for the modified functions. The tests should include different types of HTTP requests and response statuses, as well as reading and executing HTTP requests from `.hurl` files.

Here is an example of how the unit tests for the modified functions could look:

```lua
-- test/hurl_spec.lua

-- ...

describe('Hurl wrapper', function()
  -- ...

  it('should handle different types of HTTP requests and response statuses', function()
    -- TODO: Add comprehensive tests to cover different types of HTTP requests and response statuses
    -- Mock the requests and check the response statuses
  end)

  it('should correctly read and execute HTTP requests from .hurl files', function()
    -- TODO: Add comprehensive tests to cover reading and executing HTTP requests from .hurl files
    -- Mock the .hurl file and check the response statuses
  end)

  -- ...
end)
