Add the following configuration to your Neovim setup with lazy.nvim
<https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim>:

>lua
    {
      "jellydn/hurl.nvim",
      dependencies = {
          "MunifTanjim/nui.nvim",
          "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",
          "nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter"
      },
      ft = "hurl",
      opts = {
        -- Show debugging info
        debug = false,
        -- Show notification on run
        show_notification = false,
        -- Show response in popup or split
        mode = "split",
        -- Default formatter
        formatters = {
          json = { 'jq' }, -- Make sure you have install jq in your system, e.g: brew install jq
          html = {
            'prettier', -- Make sure you have install prettier in your system, e.g: npm install -g prettier
            '--parser',
            'html',
          },
          xml = {
            'tidy', -- Make sure you have installed tidy in your system, e.g: brew install tidy-html5
            '-xml',
            '-i',
            '-q',
          },
        },
      },
      keys = {
        -- Run API request
        { "<leader>A", "<cmd>HurlRunner<CR>", desc = "Run All requests" },
        { "<leader>a", "<cmd>HurlRunnerAt<CR>", desc = "Run Api request" },

When configuring nvim-treesitter add `hurl` to the `ensure_installed` list of
parsers.

Simple demo in split mode:

  [!NOTE] I frequently utilize the nightly version of Neovim, so if you encounter
  any issues, I recommend trying that version first. I may not have the time to
  address problems in the stable version. Your contributions via pull requests
  are always welcome.

ENV FILE SUPPORT: VARS.ENV              *hurl.nvim-env-file-support:-vars.env*

`hurl.nvim` seamlessly integrates with environment files named `vars.env` to
manage environment variables for your HTTP requests. These environment
variables are essential for customizing your requests with dynamic data such as
API keys, base URLs, and other configuration values.


CUSTOMIZATION ~

You can specify the name of the environment file in your `hurl.nvim`
configuration. By default, `hurl.nvim` looks for a file named `vars.env`, but
you can customize this to any file name that fits your project’s structure.

Here’s how to set a custom environment file name in your `hurl.nvim` setup:

>lua
    require('hurl').setup({
      -- Specify your custom environment file name here
      env_file = {
          'hurl.env',
      },
      -- Other configuration options...
    })
<


FILE LOCATION ~

The plugin searches for a `vars.env` (env_file config) in multiple locations to
accommodate various project structures and ensure that environment-specific
variables for your HTTP requests are easily accessible. The search occurs in
the following order:

1. **Current File’s Directory:** The directory where the current file is
located. This is particularly useful for projects where environment variables
are specific to a particular module or component.


2. **Specific Directories in Project:** The plugin scans predefined directories
within the project, which are commonly used for organizing different aspects of
a project:

- `src/`: The source code directory.
- `test/` and `tests/`: Directories typically used for test scripts.
- `server/`: If your project includes a server component, this directory is checked.
- `src/tests/` and `server/tests/`: These are checked for environment variables specific to tests within the respective `src` and `server` directories.


3. **Intermediate Directories from Git Root to Current File:** If the project is a
git repository, the plugin identifies the root of the repository and then
searches for `vars.env` in every directory on the path from this root to the
current file’s directory. This feature is particularly useful in monorepo
setups or large projects, where different modules or packages may have their
own environment variables.



By checking these locations, the plugin ensures a comprehensive search for
environment variables, catering to a wide range of project structures and
setups.


SWAPPABLE ENVIRONMENT ~

To change the environment file name, use the `HurlSetEnvFile` command followed
by the new file name. You can have multiple variable files by having
comma-separated values.


NOTES

- Ensure that the new environment file exists in the directories where the plugin searches for it, as outlined in the |hurl.nvim-file-location| section.
- This change will apply globally for the current session of Neovim. If you restart Neovim, it will revert to the default `vars.env` unless you change it again.


TEST FIXTURES                                        *hurl.nvim-test-fixtures*

This is a feature that allows you to define custom variables in your `.hurl`
files. You can define a list of custom variables with a name and a callback
function that returns the value of the variable. The callback function is
executed every time the variable is used in the `.hurl` file.


  [!NOTE] This is a workaround to inject dynamic variables into the hurl command,
  refer
  https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/hurl/issues?q=sort:updated-desc+is:open+label:%22topic:+generators%22
>lua
      -- Custom below to add your own fixture variables
      fixture_vars = {
        {
          name = 'random_int_number',
          callback = function()
            return math.random(1, 1000)
          end,
        },
        {
          name = 'random_float_number',
          callback = function()
            local result = math.random() * 10
            return string.format('%.2f', result)
          end,
        },
      }
<

Then you can use `{{random_int_number}}` and `{{random_float_number}}` in your
`.hurl` files.

>hurl
    POST https://api.example.com
    Content-Type: application/json
    
    {
      "name": "Product ID {{random_int_number}}",
      "price": {{random_float_number}}
    }
<


DEMO                                                          *hurl.nvim-demo*

Check out the following demos to see `hurl.nvim` in action:


RUN A FILE ~

Run the entire file by pressing `<leader>A` or run `HurlRunner` command.

<https://gyazo.com/e554e81788aad910848ff991c9369d7b>


RUN A SELECTION ~

Select a range of lines and press `<leader>h` to execute the request or run
`HurlRunner` command.

<https://gyazo.com/1a44dbbf165006fb5744c8f10883bb69>


RUN AT CURRENT LINE ~

Place your cursor on a HURL entry and press `<leader>a` or run `HurlRunnerAt`
command to execute the entry request.

<https://gyazo.com/20efd2cf3f73238bd57e79fc662208b1>


VERBOSE MODE

Run `HurlVerbose` command to execute the request in verbose mode. The response
will be displayed in QuickFix window. This is useful for debugging purposes or
getting the curl command from hurl file.

<https://gyazo.com/7d0f709e2db53f8c9e05655347f11bc9>


RUN TO ENTRY ~

Place your cursor on the line you want to run to that entry and press
`<leader>te` or run `HurlRunnerToEntry` command to execute the request.
<https://gyazo.com/14d47adbfcab9e945f89e020b83328a9>

Note: it’s running from start of file to the selected entry and ignore the
remaining of the file. It is useful for debugging purposes.


TOGGLE MODE ~

Run `HurlToggleMode` command to toggle between split and popup mode.

<https://gyazo.com/b36b19ab76524b95015eafe4c6e1c81f>


HURLSETVARIABLE                                    *hurl.nvim-hurlsetvariable*

The `HurlSetVariable` command allows you to set environment variables for your
HTTP requests. This is particularly useful for setting dynamic data such as API
keys, base URLs, and other configuration values.

To use this command, type `:HurlSetVariable` followed by the variable name and
its value. For example:

>vim
    :HurlSetVariable API_KEY your_api_key
<

This will set the `API_KEY` environment variable to `your_api_key`. You can
then use this variable in your `.hurl` files like this:

>hurl
    GET https://api.example.com
    Authorization: Bearer {{API_KEY}}
<


HURLMANAGEVARIABLE                              *hurl.nvim-hurlmanagevariable*

The `HurlManageVariable` command provides a convenient way to view your
environment variables. When you run this command, it opens a new buffer in
popup with the current environment variables and their values.

To use this command, simply type `:HurlManageVariable` in the command line:

>vim
    :HurlManageVariable
<

The default keymap for this buffer is:

- `q`: Close the buffer
- `e`: Edit the variable

<https://gyazo.com/0492719eb7a14f42cebff6996bde8672>

For now, if you want to modify the global variables, you can do so by using the
`HurlSetVariable` command or by editing your `vars.env` file directly.


HURLSHOWLASTRESPONSE                          *hurl.nvim-hurlshowlastresponse*

The `HurlShowLastResponse` command allows you to view the response of your last
HTTP request.

>vim
    :HurlShowLastResponse
<


DEFAULT KEY MAPPINGS                          *hurl.nvim-default-key-mappings*

`hurl.nvim` comes with some default key mappings to streamline your workflow:

- `q`: Close the current popup window.
- `<C-n>`: Switch to the next popup window.
- `<C-p>`: Switch to the previous popup window.

These key mappings are active within the popup windows that `hurl.nvim`
displays.


CONFIGURATION                                        *hurl.nvim-configuration*

`hurl.nvim` can be customized with the following default configurations:

>lua
    --- Default configuration for hurl.nvim
    local default_config = {
      debug = false,
      mode = 'split',
      show_notification = false,
      auto_close = true,
      -- Default split options
      split_position = 'right',
      split_size = '50%',
      -- Default popup options
      popup_position = '50%',
      popup_size = {
        width = 80,
        height = 40,
      },
      env_file = { 'vars.env' },
      fixture_vars = {
        {
          name = 'random_int_number',
          callback = function()
            return math.random(1, 1000)
          end,
        },
        {
          name = 'random_float_number',
          callback = function()
            local result = math.random() * 10
            return string.format('%.2f', result)
          end,
        },
      },
      find_env_files_in_folders = utils.find_env_files_in_folders,
      formatters = {
        json = { 'jq' },
        html = {
          'prettier',
          '--parser',
          'html',
        },
        xml = {
          'tidy',
          '-xml',
          '-i',
          '-q',
        },
      },
    }
<

To apply these configurations, include them in your Neovim setup like this:

>lua
    require('hurl').setup({
      debug = true,          -- Enable to show detailed logs
      mode = 'popup',        -- Change to 'popup' to display responses in a popup window
      env_file = { 'vars.env' }, -- Change this to use a different environment file name
      formatters = {
        json = { 'jq' },    -- Customize the JSON formatter command
        html = {
          'prettier',       -- Customize the HTML formatter command
          '--parser',
          'html',
        },
        xml = {
          'tidy',           -- Customize the XML formatter command
          '-xml',
          '-i',
          '-q',
        },
      },
    })
<

Adjust the settings as per your needs to enhance your development experience
with `hurl.nvim`.


TIPS ~


  [!TIP] Enable debug mode with `debug = true` for detailed logs
- Logs are saved at `~/.local/state/nvim/hurl.nvim.log` on macOS.


  [!TIP] Split mode with Edgy
- `hurl.nvim` can be used with edgy.nvim <https://github.com/folke/edgy.nvim> to manage layout when using the split mode.

>lua
    right = {
      { title = "Hurl Nvim", size = { width = 0.5 }, ft = "hurl-nvim" },
    }
<


  [!TIP] Syntax Highlighting in Stable Neovim
- If you’re using a stable version of Neovim that doesn’t support Hurl syntax highlighting, you can set the filetype to `sh` or `bash` for your `.hurl` files. This will enable basic syntax highlighting that can improve readability. To do this, add the following line to your Neovim configuration:

>vim
    autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile *.hurl setfiletype sh
<

For example, here is my autocmd
<https://github.com/jellydn/lazy-nvim-ide/commit/141edf7114839ba7656c4484f852199179c4f11f>
for `.hurl` files.
