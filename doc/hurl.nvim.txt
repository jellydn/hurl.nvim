ENV FILE SUPPORT: VARS.ENV              *hurl.nvim-env-file-support:-vars.env*

These files can manage environment variables that your HTTP requests may rely
on.

- Current file’s directory
- Project root directory
- src/
- test/
- tests/
- server/
- src/tests/
- server/tests/

DEFAULT KEY MAPPINGS                          *hurl.nvim-default-key-mappings*

`hurl.nvim` comes with some default key mappings to streamline your workflow:

- `q`: Close the current popup window.
- `<C-n>`: Switch to the next popup window.
- `<C-p>`: Switch to the previous popup window.

These key mappings are active within the popup windows that `hurl.nvim`
displays.


TIPS                                                          *hurl.nvim-tips*

You could enable debug mode with `debug = true` in your configuration to see
more information. All the logs will be printed in the `hurl.nvim.log` in Neovim
cache folder. For instance, in MacOS, the log file is located at
`~/.cache/nvim/hurl.nvim.log`.
